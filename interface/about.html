        <h1><strong>About the Developers</strong></h1>
        <p>this course selection extension was developed by three students in GMU's CS321 Spring 2023 course. 
            We came up with this idea from our experiences with selecting courses from PatriotWeb and how time-consuming it is to do such a task, from going back and forth between the course names to scrolling through all the options.
            So, we decided-- why not optimize the process? Ta-da! Thus, our browser extension idea was born. </p>
